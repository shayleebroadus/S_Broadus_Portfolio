<h1>Beans Order & Inventory App with C# and Microsoft SQL</h1>

<h2>This was a group project consisting of three components:</h2>
<h4>Completed in about two weeks with three members</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Main</li>
    <li>Items</li>
    <li>Search</li>
</ul>

<div>
    <img src="images/MainPageImage.png" alt="Main page">
    <h3>Main</h3>
    <p>Main, is used for an invoice page. Here the user is able to create, edit, and save their invoice to the sql file
    Once they create an invoice they are able to edit the invoice and add or remove items from it. The user is given a
    item total, invoice total, invoice date, invoice code, and shown their list of items in a table. </p>
</div>

<div>
    <img src="images/ItemsPageImage.png" alt="Items Page">
    <h3>Items</h3>
    <p>Items displays a list of the inventory available for purchase from this store. From this page the user can view
    details about individual items, like the item code, cost, and description. The user is able to add, edit, remove,
    and save items to the inventory from this page.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <img src="images/SearchPageImage.png" alt="Search Page">
    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>Search is simply the page to look up an invoice from the database. View the invoice date, code, and total cost.
    When the user clicks to select the invoice, the invoice is returned to the main page so that they can view the
    invoice in larger detail. The clear button on the search page will remove any filters added and renew the search.
    Most of my work had been done with this page.</p>
