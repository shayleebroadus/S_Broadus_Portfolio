# Hashtable Class with quadratic probing

A hashtable stores items in an array.  To make the items easy to retrieve each
item is stored in a specific index based on the result of the hash function.
In this assignment you will implement a hashtable which uses quadratic probing
to resolve any collisions. To focus on the operations of the hash table itself
you will be implmenting a hashtable that only stores integers.

## Goals:
The purpose of this project is to gain a firm understanding of the hashtable
data structure.  You will need to understand the purpose of the hash function,
quadratic probing and resizing the hash table.

## Requirements:

### **Hashtable class**

This class creates and manages the hashtable data structure.
Your hashtable should be implemented as an array using open addressing and
quadratic probing to resolve collisions.  Specifically the quadratic probing
equation should be H + c1*i + c2*i^2 with c1=0 and c2=1. The hashtable should
be resized dynamically any time the number of elements exceeds the load
factor threshold. You will not receive credit for other forms of implementation.

At a minimum you must implement the following public methods:

+ Hashtable() \\Constructs and empty hash table with a default capacity of 17 and a default load factor threshold of .65
+ Hashtable(int size)\\Constructs and empty hash table with the given capacity and a default load factor threshold of .65
+ Hashtable(int, double)\\Constructs and empty hash table with the given capacity and load factor threshold values
+ Hashtable(const Hashtable& other)\\creates a deep-copy of the given hashtable
+ Hashtable& operator=(const Hashtable& other)\\replaces the current hashtable with a deep-copy of the given hash table
+ ~Hashtable()\\cleans up all allocated memory of the hashtable
+ int size() const\\retunrs the number of items currently in the hashtable
+ int capacity() const\\returns the capacity of the hashtable (i.e. the size of the array)
+ double getLoadFactorThreshold() const\\returns the load factor threshold used to determine when to resize the hashtable.
+ bool empty() const\\returns true if the table is empty or false otherwise
+ void insert(const int)\\Inserts the given value into the hashtable.  Automatically resizes the table as necessary.
+ void remove(int)\\Removes the given value from the hashtable.  If the value is not present it takes no action and throws no errors.
+ bool contains(int) const\\Returns true if the given value is contained in the hashtable or false if the value is not in the hashtable.
+ int indexOf(int) const\\Returns the index of the given value.  If the value is not in the hashtable, returns -1.  This is not a normal mehtod for a hashtable and is here solely to test that your hashtable does quadratic probing.
+ void clear()\\Removes all values from the hashtable, resetting it to an empty state

For full credit you should also change the implementation of the following public methods:

+ static bool isPrime(int n)\\Returns true if the value is a prime number. One way to implement this method is to check if the number is divisible by 2-sqrt(n).  If it is then it is not prime.  If it is not then it is prime.  2 and 3 must be tested separately.
+ static int nextPrime(int n)\\Returns the next prime number greater than or equal to n.  One way to implement this method is to test if n is prime and then repeatedly increment n and test again if it is prime.
