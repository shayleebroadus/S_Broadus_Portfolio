<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
<p>This is a collection of C++ projects that use object-oriented classes to pass a test file using the correct
functions and/or solving a puzzle.</p>

    <h3>Missionaries and Cannibals Problem</h3>
    <p>In the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, there are 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on one side of a river.
    They all need to cross the river in a boat that can take two at a time. The puzzle is that on neither side of the
    river can their be more cannibals than missionaries at one time.</p>
    <!--puzzle to come up with an algorithm and class that passes the requirement to get 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals
    to the other side of a river. More Specifically: In the missionaries and cannibals problem, three missionaries and
    three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that,
    for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals -->

    <p>The MazeSolver project recursively searches a multidimensional array looking for open spaces where the path through
    the maze can continue until it reaches the exit. </p>
    <!-- Depth-first algorithm to find the answer to a maze and prints it to the console-->

    <p>In this program, it is tested with inserting values into an array after they have been hashed. If two values end
    up being assigned the same index, the class uses quadratic probing recursively until it finds an empty index to store
    the value</p>
    <!--A hashtable stores items in an array. To make the items easy to retrieve each item is stored in a specific
    index based on the result of the hash function. In this assignment you will implement a hashtable which uses
    quadratic probing to resolve any collisions. To focus on the operations of the hash table itself you will be
    implementing a hashtable that only stores integers.

<div>
    <p>The Stack data structure class creates Nodes. These nodes hold their respective data and a pointer to the next
    Node. The Stack constructor only holds the top, and bottom nodes, as well as the size. With the stack you are able
    to push a new node which will add to the top of the stack and pop to remove the item at the top of the stack as well
    as get the popped node returned. The class also has the ability to print out the entire stack to the console. As
    well as some other helper functions.</p>
