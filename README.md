- Group project - video game
  - UNABLE TO ADD FILES - File is too large
  - created a simple unpolished video game with a teammate to learn collision, movement, interaction, and animation. For this project I had written most of the animation and interaction and collision. My teammate helped with the assets and objects in blender and the camera dictation. The work was done together than a division of work like other projects.
